Q1: Link Latency and Throughput
L1 (h1-h2):
- Latency: 170.64 ms avg
- Throughput: 18.95 Mbps
L2 (h2-h3):
- Latency: 123.90 ms avg
- Throughput: 38.19 Mbps
L3 (h3-h4):
- Latency: 206.73 ms avg
- Throughput: 28.47 Mbps
L4 (h2-h5):
- Latency: 101.45 ms avg
- Throughput: 23.91 Mbps
L5 (h3-h6):
- Latency: 102.07 ms avg
- Throughput: 23.90 Mbps

Q2: Path Latency and Throughput (h1 <-> h4)
Prediction:
- Expected RTT: 160 ms ; bcs 80ms one way x 2
- Expected Throughput: 20 Mbps ; limited by L1 bottleneck

Measurements:
- Average RTT (from latency_Q2.txt): 161.27 ms
- Measured Throughput (from throughput_Q2.txt): 23.97 Mbps

Explanation:
Our predicted latency was almost exact to the real average. The throughput however was slightly higher than the 20 Mbps bottleneck we've predicted (by around 4 Mbps). This is because mininet switches buffer packets sometimes, thus allowing short bursts of traffic to exceed the strict limit at the time of the brief tests
